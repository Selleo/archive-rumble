# Rumble rules

Rumble is a long running event where you create a small piece of software based on given criteria/theme.

Rumble themes might be suggested by the community. The theme is revealed at the start of the event.

Any number of people can participate so you can work alone or in a team.

Don't be afraid to ask for help.

## Technology

You are allowed to use any technology you want. You can experiment with any programming language / framework etc. you wish.

It is strongly recommended that you only use software that you have the legal right to use.
In case you do not have the rights to use something, responsibility lies on **your** side.

## Source code 

After finishing your rumble you should upload the source code according to the [source code distribution guide]({{< relref "/docs/guides/source" >}}) so your solution can be tested by others.

## Communication

For now use `#rumble` channel on our slack or DM `@bart`.
